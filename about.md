## About me

About 7 years ago, I was just a clueless student, fascinated by infosec and dreaming of becoming a white-hat hacker.  
Fast forward to now — I’m a **Fullstack Developer**, constantly learning and pushing myself to grow.

I didn’t fully walk the path of a hacker, but I still remember the thrill of discovering a vulnerability or fixing a bug at 2-4AM.  
What stuck with me through the years is that same curiosity, passion, and a bit of rebellious spirit from when I started.

Maybe one day, I’ll put that hoodie back on and dive deeper into the world of shells and exploits.  
Until then, I build, break, and learn — one line of code at a time.
